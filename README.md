# RingBuffer

## Motivation
I see so many requests for a RingBuffer implementations and folks having to hand roll thier own. Apache Commons has a Java implementation but the user has to worry about various exceptions being thrown. So this is Scala first impementation.

## Goal
Memory efficient RingBuffer implementation.

## Work In Progress
Until the version is 1.x this should be considered a work in progress.
